Group Name: Library Card
Title: Bookstore Landing
Description: For now, the bookstore is open to the public. Certain books like educational texts, would need a special student or organization license 
to access the book for an extended period of time. Otherwise the standard or shorter rental time would apply. The site should function to allow for multiple 
books to be added to a list or catalog, which would then be compiled at checkout. The individual rental times would apply and will be logged accordingly. 
Have a remove/delete button for unwanted items.
